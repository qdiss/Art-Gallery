          KaiÄ‡ is a smaller boat with a rounded bottom. We distinguish between
          small (up to 4.80 m) and large ones (up to 8 m). The small boat is
          open along its entire length, and the large ones are covered by a deck
          on the front third. Sometimes they have a hatch with a cover for going
          down into the bow area. The bow is pointed, the stern is cut off and
          ends with a flat mirror. It is easy to handle and fast to paddle. It
          is suitable for driving in shallow areas and over shorter distances.
          It is used in small fishing, sport fishing and for recreation. In the
          past, they were used for angler fishing.
