          Betin&#39;s boat is a wooden boat with a flat bottom, with a wide
          wooden mirror at the stern. Compared to other naves, the Betina one
          has a mirror that is only slightly less wide than the width of the
          nave itself. The length of the smaller ships is from 4 to 5 meters,
          and the larger ones from 5 to 7 meters and are called laÄ‘uni. The flat
          bottom is curved towards the bow frame.

          Some boats are made with a V-shaped bottom. The proven loom is
          straight and slanted forward. The ratio of length to width is greater
          than 1:3, by an average of ten centimeters.

          The means of propulsion are two oars in soha, which are placed around
          the middle of the ship. On the upper edge of the transom, a shallow
          depression is made on one side for rowing with one oar. This way of
          rowing is called gungula.

          There is an open and a closed type of ship. Covered, they have a deck
          on 1/3 of the bow. Due to the flat bottom, it sails successfully in
          shallow waters. It serves mostly for fishing and leisure in the summer
          months.
